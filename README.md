# Events Android App
This is my second partially-complete project done as part of my PRM (Mobile Applications Development) course at PJATK university. This app is a browser for events happening in your area. It uses the default Android libraries along with Google Maps and Firebase DB.

## Features
- user account authentication based on Google Auth Provider
- ability to add, edit and remove events consisting of a name, date, image, description and geographical location
- ability to view the event location inside the Google Maps window
- events are marked on the map by markers and circles
